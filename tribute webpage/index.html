                                <p class="small">~Segregation was written into law; the front of the bus was reserved for white citizens and the back for black citizens - Negroes-in-back policy
                                    <br>~Though there were contradictory Montgomery laws: One said Segregation must be enforced, the other(largely ignored): no person could be asked to give up their seat if no other seats were available on the bus.
                                    <br>~At one point on the route back home, a man had no seat because all the seats in the "white" section were taken. The driver told the riders in the first row of the "colored" section to stand - effectively adding
                                    another row to the "white" section.
                                    <br>~Three obeyed, Parks did not. The bus driver stopped the bus.
                                    <br>~Two police officers approached the stopped bus, assessed the situation and came to a conclusion: Arrest Rosa Parks.

                                <blockquote>“People always say that I didn’t give up my seat because I was tired,” wrote Parks in her autobiography, “but that isn’t true. I was not tired physically… No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.”</blockquote>
